# Part VII (pandas)

We'll talk about 'pandas' which is a very useful Python package that enables us to do Excel like data manipulations in our code.

Often one will have:

``` py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
...
```

While 'pandas' is infact dependent on 'numpy', 'numpy' is more the linear algebra, matrix manipulations, and performance (vectorizing) considerations. 'pandas' is adding the "tabular" manipulation, filtering rows, merging tables, creating "calculated columns" etc.
