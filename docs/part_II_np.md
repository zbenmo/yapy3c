# Part II (numpy)

We take a little break from pure Python, and introduce a very useful package **numpy**. It is not part of the standard library yet easily installed, for example with (below is done in an OS shell, it is not Python):

````
pip install numpy
````

If you're working with 'pip' or with 'conda' please go and install 'numpy'. For me, 'numpy' was already available with [https://www.python.org/shell/](https://www.python.org/shell/). I've verified it with:

``` py
import numpy as np

np.__version__
```

```'1.21.6'```

(Packages also have their version, which is also very important concept to wrap your head around. For now we are good.)

We import the package and follow the convention to alias it *np*:

``` py
import numpy as np

type(np)
```

```module```

Why did I say a package? A package may contain, or bring with its installation, multiple Python modules.
Weâ€™ll talk about it later (what is a Python module?, how we create a package?, and relevant considerations).

So why is it worth it to learn about 'numpy'? Well, first it is an example of yet another useful package. Python is great, yet it is really great thanks to the ecosystem around it. There are packages for data science, packages that are part of web frameworks, packages for developing games. In particular, 'numpy', appears almost always (at least with Python software I've played with).

The theme of 'numpy' is linear algebra. For example, one can wrap a list into 'numpy.ndarray' (n-dimensional array).

``` py
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr.shape
```

```(3,)```

*len(arr)* will also work and shall return *3*.

There exists a standard module 'array' in Python that also deals with memory efficient arrays. We'll skip 'array' and jump directly to 'numpy' which is what people often do these days. Potentially 'numpy' is making use of 'array' behind the scenes.

The 'shape' returns a tuple where each entry is the length of the relevant dimension. Note the comma in *(3,)*. This is to distinguish this value, which is a tuple, from *(3)* which is just the scalar *3* after the expression is evaluated.

An important observation is that while a simple list can contain heterogeneous values, a 'numpy' array is expected to hold values of the same type in all cells. In addition to many goodies that we'll see soon, 'numpy' is intended to make the calculations fast and vectorized. Vectorisation is a technique where special hardware manipulate multiple cells at the same time.

To find the type of the elements themselves, use:

``` py
arr.dtype
```
In this example it is ```dtype('int64')```.

To find the dimension of a 'numpy' array, one can do:

``` py
len(arr.shape)
```

```1```

Here BTW we see that 'len' works also on a tuple.

I've recently learned that one can also just issue:

``` py
arr.ndim
```

Which should give the same result ```1```.

To find how many elements in a 'numpy' array, I would go for:

``` py
np.prod(arr.shape)
```

```3```

Above, we see a nice utility function from 'numpy' that takes an iterable, in this case the tuple *arr.shape*, and returns the product of the elements.

Let's go to the next dimension:

``` py
mat = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 0], [2, 1]]); mat
```

```
array([[1, 2],
       [1, 0],
       [2, 1]])
```

We used ';' to separate two expressions. The last expression *mat* is what we see in the interactive shell. We see that we got a matrix with *3* rows and *2* columns.

``` py
len(mat.shape), np.prod(mat.shape)
```

```(2, 6)```

Here we used ',' between the two expressions. This gave us the tuple *(2, 6)*. The first element of the tuple is the dimension of *mat* and the other is the count of elements in *mat* (similar to what we've verified above for *arr*).

A 2-dimentional 'numpy' array or, a "matrix" has two **axes**; *0* and *1*. One axis is the rows and the other is the columns.
Let's see that in action:

``` py
np.sum(mat), np.sum(mat, axis=0), np.sum(mat, axis=1)
```

```(7, array([4, 3]), array([3, 1, 3]))```

We can see that without the *axis* parameter we get a scalar which is the sum of all the elements. With *axis=0* the rows collapse and we get the summation per columns. With *axis=1* the columns collapse, and we end up with as many entries in the result 'numpy' array as we had rows. 

Let's try the following advanced exercise. We're given a matrix. We return another matrix according to the following rules. If a cell in the input matrix is zero, the matching "cell" in the return matrix will be *3* by *3* zeros. Otherwise, a none zero value, will result with a matching "cell" of *3* by *3* ones. It will get soon clear when you'll see the example output.

``` py linenums="1"
def inflate(input_matrix):
    res = []
    for row in range(0, input_matrix.shape[0]):
        res_row = []
        for col in range(0, input_matrix.shape[1]):
            submatrix = input_matrix[row:row + 1, col:col + 1]
            transformed = np.zeros((3, 3)) if submatrix == 0 else np.ones((3, 3))
            res_row.append(transformed)
        res.append(np.concatenate(res_row, axis=1))
    return np.concatenate(res, axis=0)
```

```
array([[1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]])
```

Note that, on line *6* we access a submatrix (in this case just *1* by *1*) using indices (similar to slicing in lists).

The assignment to the variable *transformed* on line *7* needs a clarification. This is the equivalent of the ternary operator from *C/C++*. In *C* we have ```cond ? val_when_true : val_when_false```. With Python this would be ```val_when_true if cond else val_when_false```.

Maybe there is a smarter way to achieve what was done above in the function *inflate*. That is what I came up with.

And now it is your turn.

## Exercise

This course is originated in the Netherlands :flag_nl:. Which means that we need to do something with a windmill.
Here are some building blocks that may help.

``` py
np.tri(4)
```

```
array([[1., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 1., 0.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1.]])
```

``` py
np.tri(4).T # transpose
```

```
array([[1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [0., 1., 1., 1.],
       [0., 0., 1., 1.],
       [0., 0., 0., 1.]])
```

``` py
np.flip(np.tri(4), axis=0)
```

```
array([[1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 0.],
       [1., 1., 0., 0.],
       [1., 0., 0., 0.]])
```
